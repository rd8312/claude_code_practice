- Lessons 3-6 add features to the starting codebase.
- Here's [the state](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/ragchatbot-codebase) of the codebase after lesson 5.

Feel free to fork the starting codebase and follow the lessons' activities.

### E-commerce data analysis (Lesson 7)

- Here are [the lesson's files](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/sc-claude-code-files/tree/main/lesson7_files).

Feel free to fork this repo, and try lesson 7 tasks using the starting notebook and the data folder.

### Figma design mockup (Lesson 8)

- Here's [the link](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/sc-claude-code-files/blob/main/additional_files/key-indicators.fig) to the Figma mockup design (which you can open with [Figma Desktop App](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/5601429983767-Guide-to-the-Figma-desktop-app)).
- In lesson 8, you will build a Next.js app based on this mockup.
- Here's the [link](https://github.com/https-deeplearning-ai/FRED-dashboard) to the repo of the app we got during filming.
